        <h2>Landon Green Program</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>The Landon Hotel - London</strong> was recently renovated, and
          we considered the impact on the earth the entire way. From green
          building materials, to solar power, to energy-friendly lighting and
          appliances throughout the hotel - we’re saving energy in every socket,
          outlet, and switch. We’ve also initiated a recycling and composting
          program that reduces the load to local landfills, while providing
          valuable raw material for use in new products, or in the case of
          compost, for use in local gardens and landscapes.
